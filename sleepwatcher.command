#sleepwatcher.sh installs homebrew, installs sleepwatcher then creates the launching daemons to catch and kill opendirectoryd each time the laptop goes out from sleep mode
#There is a bug on how mac os bind to Active Directory using the native opendirectoryd daemon making the password uneffective when the computer goes out of sleep mode. There is no open case registered at Apple for this issue, as far as i know.
